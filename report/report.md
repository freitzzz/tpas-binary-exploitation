# Binary Exploitation of Figlet Unix Binary

The present report, written in the context of TPAS (Teoria e Prática de Ataques de Segurança) curricular unit at FCUP (Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade do Porto), aims at describing the process of attempting to find bugs and crashes in a command-line binary for Unix-like systems.
It will start by describing the goals of the project, methodologies being followed, approaches to take and technologies to look on. Then, it will be presented the binary in context of analysis, depicting initial weakness and the reasons to why it was chosen as the target binary. Following this, the working environment and tools used for exploitation will be described in detail, focusing on the quirks and constraints felt during the setup phase. The fourth chapter describes the fuzzing process and achieved results in an iterative manner. 
To conclude, an overview of the overall effectiveness and complexity of performing such analysis will be presented, as well as some remarks for future work.

## 1. Terminologies, Methodologies, Technologies and Goals

Binary exploitation can be defined as the process of "finding a vulnerability in the program and exploiting it to gain control of a shell or modifying the program's functions" [1].
To gain control of a shell, typically newbie attackers inject shellcode in the program through an input stream (e.g., user input(stdin)), which allows for arbitrary code execution (i.e., using a program as the interpreter of crafted binary code). Shellcode is a special type of code produced with assembly instructions, for a specific CPU architecture [2].

Despite shellcode attacks still being popular and effective for a wide range of use cases, more advanced attackers rely on *Return Oriented Programming* (ROP), a technique that exploits the program call stack by hijacking the memory and aligning the assembly instructions present on it to execute code in an arbitrary way [3].
This technique is way more effective on modern age binaries, as these are protected with specific security flags on compile time (e.g., NX, ASLR, Stack Canary) that detect if whether a program was compromised or not during runtime, via a memory corruption [3].

**But how do attackers find vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary code execution?**

To craft code and execute it in a target program, we first need to load it in the program memory so it can be arbitrarily triggered and executed by the program. Since modern operating systems reserve specific memory spaces for a program, no entity can write to this memory in an external manner. So, to write in the program memory, it is needed to *conduct the program to do it so*. This is where the vulnerabilities take place: there is a need to find usage of unsafe operations in a binary, so that specific input or program flow can corrupt the reserved memory. Classic vulnerabilities include:

- **Buffer Overflow**, where data bigger than the actual buffer (i.e., memory space) is written to it, which causes this data to be propagated in the memory, until a crash occurs [4];
- **Use After Free (UAF)**, which occurs when a specific chunk of memory is used after it was deallocated/freed [4, 5];
- **Format Strings**, which occurs when programs that use operations that rely on format strings (e.g., `printf` and `sprintf`) are vulnerable to format operations injection, which will force format strings functions to look for arguments to replace on the format position [4, 5].

```
char buf[8];

void vulnerable() {
    gets(buf);
}
```

Code Snippet 1 - Example of a buffer overflow. The `gets` function does not check for the buffer length, so any input with length greater than **8**, will cause a buffer overflow.

One very important thing to note, is that memory corruptions are far more easy to occur in "low level" programming languages such as `C` and `C++`, rather in high level ones (e.g., `Javascript, C#`), as the former allows for direct dynamic memory allocation and does not have memory optimizers, such as *garbage collection*. This gives an hint on the programs to choose for trying to find memory vulnerabilities.

**Okay, this is great and seems easy. Can I hack the government with binary exploitation?**

While theoretically you sure can exploit any binary to arbitrarily execute code, these kind of attacks have been disclosed since the late 80s, and so there is a lot progress on detecting memory vulnerabilities in software, both during compile and runtime. So most likely you cannot exploit any binary by just slapping fingers, but that does not mean that exploiting the binary is impossible!

The state-of-the-art for analyzing and exploiting binaries, divides these processes in two approaches: the white-box approach, where one has access to the source-code of the binary and as such can find vulnerabilities in a static analysis manner; and the black-box approach, which assumes that the binary is a black-box that no one knows how it is built, giving input to it and expecting to receive a specific output.
One can argue that white-box analysis is the best approach to follow, as an experienced security researcher or programmer knows every weakness of a programming language, however access to the source-code is not always available. Usually, the community relies on the black-box approach through an automated process called ***Fuzzing***.

## 1.1 What is Fuzzing?

OWASP defines fuzzing as a "black box software testing technique, which basically consists in finding implementation bugs using malformed/semi-malformed data injection in an automated fashion" [6]. It is very similar to property-based testing (PBT), where by producing random input and applying mutations to customize it, the program is faced with inputs it may have not been considering, leading to unexpected or undesired behaviour.

Fuzzing is an automatic process, which makes finding bugs an exciting process! Security researchers can just leave their machines *fuzzing* the binary during the night and analyze the collected results during the day. By default, it is efficient. However, it does not grant effectiveness, as it is still the job of the researcher to prepare the fuzzing *campaign* and guide it.
