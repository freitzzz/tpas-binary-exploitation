# Binary Exploitation of Figlet Unix Binary

The present report, written in the context of TPAS (Teoria e Prática de Ataques de Segurança) curricular unit at FCUP (Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade do Porto), aims at describing the process of attempting to find bugs and crashes in a command-line binary for Unix-like systems.
It will start by describing the goals of the project, methodologies being followed, approaches to take and technologies to look on. Then, it will be presented the binary in context of analysis, depicting initial weakness and the reasons to why it was chosen as the target binary. Following this, the working environment and tools used for exploitation will be described in detail, focusing on the quirks and constraints felt during the setup phase. The fourth chapter describes the fuzzing process and achieved results in an iterative manner. To conclude, some final remarks and overall achievements will be presented and discussed.
To conclude, an overview of the overall effectiveness and complexity of performing such analysis will be presented, as well as some remarks for future work.
